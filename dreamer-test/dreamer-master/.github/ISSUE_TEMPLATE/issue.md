<!--
Hi there, I'm happy to answer questions about the Dreamer agent, its implementation in this repository, and to look into bugs on a best-effort basis. This means that I sometimes respond quickly and sometimes it may take a few weeks when I'm busy.

There is a strict rule to open one issue per individual question. You might have multiple questions. In this case, open multiple issues for them. This lets others find existing questions more easily and lets me keep an overview.
